## Story
It's Halloween and the kids are running through the streets.
They ring all the houses and yell "We want something sweet,
otherwise it's sour!"

You may not be a child anymore, but you still like to annoy people
your neighbours. That's why you quickly put on a corpse costume,
take your flamethrower and ring at all
the houses. In the end there will be no more houses (`HARR HARR`) !
But be careful: If you come to a torched house
go back, the cops will bag you.

## Goal
Visit all houses without visiting one twice. Passport
also make sure you don't get stuck, otherwise you'll have to
you restart.


## Controls
- WASD or arrow keys to move
- You cannot go back to the field you just came from come
- Press R to restart the level
- Click on one of the arrows at the top left and right to select the to change levels

Have fun!
